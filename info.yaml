# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_it_works: |
      Adds 2 8 Bit Floating Point Numbers under consideration of rounding and infinity cases.
      The two Floats use the 8 Bit Input and the 8 Bit bidirectional Input.
      1 Bit Sign, 4 Bit Exponent, 3 Bit Mantissa.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Every clock the output should give the Addition of the two Floats.

# A description of what the inputs do (e.g. red button, SPI CLK, SPI MOSI, etc).
  inputs:               
    - a_sign = ui_in[7]
    - a_expo = ui_in[6:3]
    - a_mant = ui_in[2:0]
# A description of what the outputs do (e.g. status LED, SPI MISO, etc)
  outputs:
    - uo_out[7]   = sign
    - uo_out[2:0] = mant
    - uo_out[6:3] = expo
# A description of what the bidirectional I/O pins do (e.g. I2C SDA, I2C SCL, etc)
  bidirectional:
    - b_sign = uio_in[7]
    - b_expo = uio_in[6:3]
    - b_mant = uio_in[2:0]
